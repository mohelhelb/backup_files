### Backup Files

This Bash shell script is aimed at backing up the files/directories in the *config_file.txt* file. By default, the parent directory that serves the purpose of containing the directories that, in turn, contain the tarfiles, *backup_files* directory, is created in the user's *home* directory (*/home/"user"/backup_files*). However, it can also be specified by invoking the script along with the appropriate option (*d*). Since the *config_file.txt* file plays a major role in that it contains the user-chosen files/directories to be backed up, the user is asked to create it, if it does not exist, and/or populate it, if it is empty, at runtime. The non-existent files/directories and duplicate ones in the *config_file.txt* file are discarded; only the valid files/directories are archived and compressed into a tarfile in a directory within the *backup_files* directory. It's also worth mentioning that running this script generates separate tarfiles provided that it is executed on different dates. Otherwise, the existing tarfile is overwritten by the new created one.
